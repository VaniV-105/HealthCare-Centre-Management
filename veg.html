        <h3>What Is a Vegetarian Diet?</h3>
        <br><br><br><br><p>
           <br><br>
        There are many variations of a vegetarian diet. On one end of the spectrum, vegan diets consist <br>
        strictly of plant-based foods.People who follow this type of vegetarian diet donot eat meat, fish,<br>
         milk, eggs, or honey. So-called lacto vegetarians eat plant-based foods and dairy products. People<br>
          who eat a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet eat plant-based foods, eggs, and dairy products.Pescatarians<br>
           eat plant-based foods and seafood. Some people follow a partial vegetarian diet in which they eat<br>
         plant-based foods, eggs, dairy products, chicken, or fish, but they avoid red meat.</p><br><br>       <br><br> <br><br>

    <span > <h3>Get Adequate Protein</h3>
       <br><br> <br><br><br><br><p>
        <br>
        It is possible to get adequate protein from a vegetarian diet, but you need to make<br>
             smart choices. Good sources of protein include beans, eggs, peas, nuts, and soy products like <br>
             veggie burgers, tempeh, and tofu. It can be challenging to consume enough calories by eating a<br>
              vegetarian diet, but it is possible. Eat a mix of protein and carbs with every meal to get <br>
              adequate protein and calories. Black beans and rice supply protein and carbs. Add a side<br>
               salad and you have a complete vegetarian meal.</p>

        <div >  <h3>Is Vegetarian the Healthiest Diet?</h3><br><br><br><br><br>
             Is a vegetarian diet healthier than other diets? Since vegetarian diets tend to be low in animal<br>
              products or eliminate them all together, they are low in cholesterol and saturated fat. Numerous <br>
              studies have shown that people who eat a vegetarian diet have a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 <br>
              diabetes, and cancer. Diets high in antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables are beneficial to health and <br>
              may help reduce the risk of cancer.  </div> <br><br><br><br>
